-agent can log paths and intersections

-Dead-Ends
-Save agent data

Testing:
-Load different mazes
-Load AI data
-Running works
-Pausing works
-Starting over works
-AI agent successfully passes at least 3 mazes and is able to log the data
-upon dead ends, return to previous intersection and deem that path unviable
-coming across 2 dead ends from a T, that intersection becomes a dead-end
-altering time speed factor
-altering rules
